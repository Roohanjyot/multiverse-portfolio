# Professional Projects

In my time at Amex, I have been able to work on four distinct applications. The majority of my year has been focused on Choreo graph but since my team has been on the forefronts of innovation, I have had the chance to learn and improve the Choroe playbook (which acts as a learning portal for Choreos API) and the new Choreo graph (which will federate our graph structure). Additionally, I had the chance to participate in a internal hackathon which was based on implementing a minimal trust SOR architecture focused on availability and partition tolerance.

## Choreo graph

It is the core product that me and my team builds and maintains that acts a middle logic layer between the client side and the SOR. 
I have been responsible for onboarding a new client team to our graph, collaborate in developing three features for the graph and fixing eight bugs existing in the graph. I have also actively participated in presenting newer ideas to the graph in the form of knowledge sharing presentations as well as presenting on behalf of my team to the whole Amex dev community.

## Choreo playbook

Due to the over relience of a liberary while building the previous learning portal for client team to introduce Choreo and its APIs. Our team was heavily restricted in what functionality could be added to the learning portal and how the information gets consumed by the clients while exploring the portal.
To improve the issues, my team decided to develop a now learning portal built on Nextjs, and I am part of the handful members of my team that got to built such a initiative.

## Hyperledger Demo

Inspired by the brittle and costly nature of the current SOR architecture, my team aimed to improve the availability and the partition tolerance of the architecute by introducing the idea and a working prototype the introduction of blockchain into the backend. 
By using the the Hyperledger Fabic, a backend blockchain based liberary. My team build a working prototype in four days which is capable of being effortlessly scable horizontally while also have near zero trust security philosophy.

## New Choreo graph

As a initiative of my team to make Choreo more performant and less faulty due to Javascipt being aggrisively implicit. Our team decided to move to Kotlin.
This newer capability is still in its early stages but I have been able to collaborate of other active contributors of this project to help develop new features and share knowledge on how to start contributing to its code base.
