# Multiverse Final Portfolio

## Overview

Over the past year or so with Multiverse and Amex, I have learned and implemented an array of different technologies. From starting the bootcamp learning Vanilla Javascript, to now having worked with three enterprise application with Amex,
it's been a great year!

This repository is a collection of the work and learning that I've done throughout my time here at Multiverse/Amex.

## [Professional Projects](https://github.com/roohanjyot/tree/main/multiverse-portfolio/professional-project)

In this section, I will discuss my experience as a developer at Amex. It describes my responsibilites and accomplishments. Due to the sensitive nature of the Amex codebase, I will not share any code or internal logic.

## Thank You!

My time here with Multiverse has been incredible, and I will always be grateful for this experience. I couldn't have asked for a better way to kickstart my career in development.

Thank you Amex for trusting me with this amazing opportunity. I have learned and grown so much as a developer.

Thank you to my brillient Multiverse coach Jonathan Jaka for all your help throughout the apprenticeship. It wouldn't have been the same without your positive energy and kindness!
